# üß™ Model Diagnostics and Hyperparameter Tuning

This project explores key methods for diagnosing and improving machine learning model performance. It focuses on:

1. Identifying overfitting and underfitting using learning curves
2. Hyperparameter tuning via **Grid Search Cross-Validation**
3. Evaluating models using **ROC curves**

---

## üì¶ Tools & Libraries

- **Python 3**
- **Scikit-learn** for modeling and grid search
- **Matplotlib** for visualizing learning curves and ROC
- **NumPy / Pandas** for data handling

---

## üîç Key Topics

### 1. Overfitting & Underfitting
- **Underfitting**: Model performs poorly on both training and validation sets.
- **Overfitting**: Model performs well on training data but poorly on validation/test data.
- **Learning Curves** are plotted to detect these issues and guide model complexity choices.

### 2. Grid Search Cross-Validation
- Systematic search over a range of hyperparameter values.
- Each combination is evaluated using cross-validation to select the best one.
- Reduces manual tuning and helps find a model that generalizes well.

### 3. ROC Curve
- Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) plots True Positive Rate vs. False Positive Rate.
- Useful for visualizing classification thresholds and model discrimination capability.
- **AUC (Area Under Curve)** provides a single performance metric.

## ‚úÖ Usage

Run the enhanced Python script with:

```bash
python model_diagnostics_and_tuning.py
```

This script will:

- Generate learning curves for different training set sizes
- Run grid search on a specified classifier (e.g., Logistic Regression or SVC)
- Plot the ROC curve for the best model

---

## üìà Outcome

By the end of the execution, you‚Äôll gain insights into:

- When your model is too simple or too complex
- How to choose hyperparameters that balance bias and variance
- Which model performs best in binary classification using ROC/AUC

---

## üß† Next Steps

Consider trying:
- Randomized Search for faster tuning
- Cross-validation strategies like StratifiedKFold
- Precision-Recall curves for imbalanced datasets
