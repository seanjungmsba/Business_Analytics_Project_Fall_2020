# ðŸ“Š Logistic Regression Analysis

This project demonstrates the application of **Logistic Regression** to a classification problem using Python. It includes standardization, model training, performance evaluation, and visualization of decision boundaries and learning curves.

---

## ðŸ“¦ Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- **NumPy** for numerical operations
- **Pandas** for data handling
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for visualization
- **Scikit-learn** for model training, evaluation, and utility functions

## ðŸ§  Key Concepts Covered

### 1. Feature Standardization
- Normalize input features to ensure equal contribution to model performance.
- Improves convergence of optimization algorithms in logistic regression.

### 2. Logistic Regression
- Supervised learning algorithm for binary classification.
- Models the probability of a class using the logistic sigmoid function.

### 3. Decision Boundary Visualization
- Plot classification regions to show how logistic regression separates classes.
- Useful to understand model behavior and overfitting tendencies.

### 4. Cross-Validation
- Estimate generalization performance using **K-Fold Cross Validation**.
- Ensures robust performance metrics not dependent on a single split.

### 5. Learning Curves
- Plots showing how training and validation scores evolve with more training data.
- Helps detect underfitting vs. overfitting issues.

## ðŸ§ª Evaluation Metrics

- **Accuracy Score**
- **Cross-validation Mean & Std**
- **Visualization of Decision Surfaces**

## ðŸ“Œ File Structure

- `logistic_regression_analysis.py`: Python script containing all logic
- `logistic_regression_analysis.md`: This markdown file with explanations and guidance

---

## âœ… How to Run

You can run the `.py` script in any Python 3 environment:

```bash
python logistic_regression_analysis.py
```

Ensure all dependencies (NumPy, sklearn, matplotlib, etc.) are installed in your environment.

## ðŸ“ˆ Conclusion

This project provides a solid foundation for understanding how logistic regression works and how to apply it effectively in real-world datasets. For further exploration, consider:

- Using more complex datasets
- Applying regularization (L1, L2)
- Exploring ROC and precision-recall curves
