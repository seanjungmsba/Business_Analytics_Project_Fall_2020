# ðŸŒ³ Decision Tree Classifier Analysis

This project demonstrates how to build and evaluate a **Decision Tree Classifier** using Python and essential data science libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

The objective is to perform the following steps in a structured and interpretable way:

1. **Load and inspect the dataset**  
2. **Clean and preprocess the data**  
3. **Train a Decision Tree model**  
4. **Evaluate its performance**  
5. **Visualize the results**

## ðŸ§  What is a Decision Tree?

A **Decision Tree** is a supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used for both classification and regression tasks. It splits data into subsets based on the value of input features, creating a tree-like model of decisions.

Key benefits:
- Easy to understand and interpret
- No need for feature scaling or normalization
- Handles both numerical and categorical data

Common drawback:
- Prone to overfitting if not pruned or regularized

## ðŸ“¦ Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **NumPy** for numerical computations
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for data visualization
- **Scikit-learn** for model training and evaluation

---

## ðŸ“‚ Code Structure

- **Imports & Setup**: Import necessary libraries and configure environment
- **Data Loading**: Read the dataset into a DataFrame
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Basic stats and visualization
- **Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, etc.
- **Model Training**: Fit a `DecisionTreeClassifier` from scikit-learn
- **Model Evaluation**: Compute accuracy, confusion matrix, etc.
- **Visualization**: Tree plotting and feature importance

## ðŸ“ˆ How the Classifier Works

Scikit-learn's `DecisionTreeClassifier` operates by:

1. Finding the best feature and split threshold that reduces impurity (e.g., Gini or entropy)
2. Recursively partitioning data into subtrees
3. Building a full tree (with options to limit depth, min samples, etc.)

Once trained, the model can predict new inputs by traversing the decision path from root to leaf.

## âœ… Example Usage

Once the script is run, youâ€™ll see:

- Printed accuracy score
- Visual representation of the decision tree
- Insights into which features influenced decisions the most

---

## ðŸ“Œ Conclusion

This notebook is a good starting point for learning and applying Decision Trees in practice. To improve the model, you can try:

- Feature selection
- Pruning or limiting tree depth
- Trying ensemble methods like Random Forest or Gradient Boosted Trees
