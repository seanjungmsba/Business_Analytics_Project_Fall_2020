# ðŸŒ² Classification Methods

This lecture compares classification algorithms including k-NN, Decision Trees, and Logistic Regression.

## ðŸ“Š Models

### k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
- Non-parametric, lazy learner.
- Sensitive to irrelevant features and high-dimensionality.

### Decision Trees
- Intuitive model with hierarchical splits.
- Flexible but can overfit on small datasets.

### Logistic Regression
- Produces class probabilities using a sigmoid function.
- Best for linear relationships.

## ðŸ“‰ Overfitting & Underfitting
- Cross-validation is key to identifying generalization performance.

## âœ… Choosing Models
- k-NN is best for simple problems and smaller data.
- Decision Trees for large, complex patterns.
- Logistic Regression for interpretable linear boundaries.
