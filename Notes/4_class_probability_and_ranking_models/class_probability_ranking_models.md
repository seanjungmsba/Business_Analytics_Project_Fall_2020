# ðŸ“ˆ Class Probability & Ranking Models

This module focuses on estimating class membership probabilities and ranking predictions.

## ðŸŽ¯ Probability Estimation
- Outputs likelihood of class membership, not just class labels.
- Useful in applications like churn prediction and fraud detection.

## ðŸ“Š ROC & AUC
- **ROC Curve**: Plots true positive rate vs. false positive rate.
- **AUC (Area Under Curve)**: Measures overall model performance (0.5 = random, 1.0 = perfect).

## ðŸ§ª Evaluation Metrics
- **Precision**: TP / (TP + FP)
- **Recall**: TP / (TP + FN)
- **F1 Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.

## ðŸ“Œ Additional Topics
- Cross-validation
- Learning curves vs. fitting graphs
- Profit curves & cost-sensitive analysis
