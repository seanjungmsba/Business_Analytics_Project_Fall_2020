# ðŸ§© Clustering & Unsupervised Learning

This section introduces techniques to find hidden patterns in data without labeled outcomes.

## ðŸ“Œ Core Concepts

### Clustering
- Groups data points into clusters where intra-cluster similarity is high.
- **k-Means** is most common: updates centroids to minimize within-cluster variance.

### Evaluation Methods
- **Elbow Method**: Plot within-cluster SSE vs. number of clusters to find optimal k.
- **Silhouette Score**: Measures how similar an object is to its own cluster vs. other clusters.

### Use Cases
- Customer segmentation
- Text clustering
- Market basket analysis

## ðŸ§  Unsupervised Learning vs Supervised
- Unsupervised: No predefined labels.
- Supervised: Requires labeled training data.
